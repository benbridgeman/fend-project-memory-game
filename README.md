## Instructions

The game will begin when you click the first card, indicated immediately by the timer (This timer will record and return a timestamp when the game is completed). 

Flipping over two cards will initiate a comparison, matching or non-matching cards will display an appropriate animation (matching cards will show a 'rubber-band' animation and will remain in an open state, non-matching cards will shake before flipping back to their default state).

Each time a pair of cards is selected for comparison, the 'Move' counter will increase by 1. Depending on the number of moves during the game, the 'Star rating' will decrease (On the 16th 'move' the star rating will drop to 2 etc).

When the game is completed (all cards matched) the game will display a score sheet displaying the time, moves, star rating and a restart button.
